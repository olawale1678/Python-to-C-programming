# Project Title: Printing

This code is a simple C program that prints the phrase "VIVID IMAGINATION" to the console. The program first includes the stdio.h header file, which provides functions for input and output operations. The main() function is the entry point of the program. Inside the main() function, the printf() function is used to print the string "VIVID IMAGINATION" to the console. The %s format specifier indicates that the value should be printed as a string.
